### About This Project
Created by Karen Mani (B.A. in Computer Science, Class of 2021) and Heather Stebbins (Professor in Electronic and Computer Music) at The George Washington University. This virtual installation works at the intersection of CS and music to expose the Bhangra community to a broader audience. Using p5.js and basic HTML/CSS, users can listen to different instruments used in Bhangra music and process sounds using their body movements.
