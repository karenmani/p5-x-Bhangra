### About This Project
A project created by Karen Mani (B.A. in Computer Science, Class of 2021) and Heather Stebbins (Professor in Electronic and Computer Music) at The George Washington University. Using p5.js and basic HTML/CSS, this installation was built at the intersection of CS and music to expose the Bhangra community to a broader audience.
